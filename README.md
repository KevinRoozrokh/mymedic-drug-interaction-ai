## Cool Features
MyMedic stands out with Gemini AI integration for accurate, multimodal analysis—turning complex medical data into actionable insights:

- **Prescription Upload & AI Extraction**: Snap a photo or upload text of your script—Gemini AI parses details instantly, extracting drug names, dosages, frequencies, and durations. Get tailored summaries on usage, potential side effects, and adherence tips.

- **MedGPT AI Chatbot**: Powered by Gemini, chat naturally about "What are the interactions between Lipitor and metformin?" or "Symptoms of high blood pressure?" Responses include evidence-based explanations, severity ratings, and emergency flags with pro consultation prompts. Context-aware for follow-ups.

- **Advanced Drug Interaction Checker**: Select 2+ meds for real-time Gemini-enhanced scans. Color-coded alerts (red for critical, e.g., QT prolongation risks; yellow for minor). Includes mechanisms (e.g., CYP450 inhibition), food/alcohol warnings, and mitigation strategies—drawing from vast knowledge bases.

- **Medication Dashboard & Explorer**: Searchable hub for 500+ drugs (sourced from FDA, RxNorm, DrugBank). Filter by category (e.g., Cardiovascular, Diabetes), class (e.g., Statins), or popularity. Cards show generics, indications, side effects, costs, and interaction counts. Recently viewed and bookmarked sections for quick access.

- **Smart Drug Comparison Tool**: Pit 2-3 medications head-to-head—compare efficacy, side effects, costs, forms (tablet vs. injection), and patient ratings. Gemini generates pros/cons summaries; export as PDF for doctor shares.

- **Symptom Analysis & Health Guidance**: Query symptoms for possible causes, red flags, and next steps (e.g., "Chest pain after starting amlodipine?"). Integrates with health profiles for personalized alerts, like allergy conflicts.

- **Personalization & Tools Suite**:
  - **Health Profile**: Track allergies, current meds, BMI, providers—auto-personalizes checks (e.g., flags NSAIDs for kidney issues).
  - **Bookmarks**: Save drugs, interactions, or chats with notes/tags; search/export for records.
  - **Pill Identifier**: Upload images for shape/color/imprint matching via Gemini vision.
  - **Dosage Calculator**: Adjusts for weight/age/renal function; safety warnings included.
